 To run equSA, you need to change the following parameters and recompile it:

 1.  DataNum=100, DataP=200, MaxNei=22;
      
     DataNum is n, i.e., the number of observations,
     DataP   is p, i.e., the number of variables,
     MaxNei  should be set around n/log(n), but much be less than n-4.


2.  ALPHA1=0.05, ALPHA2=0.01;
    
    ALPHA1 is the signficance level used in correlation screeing,
    and ALPHA2 is the significance level used in \psi-screening.

3.  ins=fopen("TR0.dat","r"); 
      
    Replace "TR0.dat" by your own data file, where the data is 
    arranged in "n rows and p columns". 
    
4.  To plot the Gaussian Graphical networks, you can run plot.R 
    with the following command in R:
    >source("plot.R")
